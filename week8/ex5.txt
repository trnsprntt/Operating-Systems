Virtual addresses form the virtual address space, which is an abstraction of physical memory and disk. 
Physical address refers directly to physical memory. 

Computers that don't have virtual memory refer a virtual address directly to the physical memory with the same address. 
Computers with virtual memory have "a function" that
for each virtual address provides its corresponding physical address (in main memory or on disk).

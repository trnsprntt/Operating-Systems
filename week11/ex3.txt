In the first code example the same buffer is used by parent and child processes,
so when new line character is met during the execution, data from the buffer is written to output stream in parallel.

In the second case: since new line character is included in the first printf instruction, data from the buffer
is written to the output stream immediately. So, when the process forks, the buffer would be empty.

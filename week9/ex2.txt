The sequence that has consecutive repetition of the same page as many times as posible will increase hit/miss ratio, 
as MMU would keep referencing only the pages that are already in memory
For example
4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
or
4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5  

On the countrary, the sequenca that has as little repetition of requested pages as it is possible
will decrease hit/miss ratio, since every page have to be loaded to memory
For example
1 2 3 4 5 6 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
